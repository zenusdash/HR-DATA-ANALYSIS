HR Data Analysis Project
Project Overview
This project involves comprehensive HR data analytics on a large-scale dataset containing employee records from a multinational corporation (MNC). With over 2 million entries, each record provides detailed employee information such as personal identifiers, job-related attributes, performance ratings, employment status, work mode, and salary data. The primary goal is to support HR professionals in data-driven decision-making for workforce optimization, attrition analysis, salary trends, and performance evaluation.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleansing and normalization utilities to handle raw employee data for robust analytics.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identification of workforce distribution by department, work mode (remote vs. on-site), employee status (active, resigned, retired, terminated), and attrition metrics.

Salary Analysis: Calculation of mean salaries by department and job title, with visual insights into top earners and salary trends.

Performance Evaluation: Examination of performance ratings across departments to find patterns influencing compensation and retention.

Advanced Visualizations: Generation of pie charts, bar charts, and other statistical plots for easy interpretation and reporting using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Reporting Tools: Automated generation of detailed reports addressing common HR questions such as attrition rates, department distributions, and regional employee concentrations.
